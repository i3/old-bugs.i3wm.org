Hello Michael,<br />
</p>
<p>
As discussed on bug <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/534" title="defect: tabbed layout and resizing tool (closed: fixed)">#534</a>, different kinds of clicking can be usefull for the user to get different results (focus, resizing tool, etc.).<br />
</p>
<p>
As we said, they are many possible ideas, like for example :<br />
</p>
<p>
1°) click (1 sec) on a tab makes the tab to be focused ; click (more than 1sec) on a tab calls the resizing tool ;<br />
</p>
<p>
2°) click on a tab makes the tab to be focused ; click+Mod1 on a tab calls the resizing tool.<br />
</p>
<p>
Thanks a lot for i3 !<br />
</p>
<p>
Best regards,<br />
</p>
<p>
Julien<br />

This behaviour should be configurable. Another use case (from <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/570" title="enhancement: Configurable mouse bindings (closed: duplicate)">#570</a>):<br />
</p>
<p>
It would be great if you could configure the bindings for the mouse (such as $mod+button1 to drag and $mod+button2 to resize floating windows) in a similar way as the bindings for the keyboard.<br />
I know it's probably too complex for the simplicity intended for i3, but I didn't know if asking here for a specific binding would be reasonable (what I actually would need is that $mod+button4/5 over a window switched to the previous/next window in stacked mode, just like button4/5 do over the window decoration, but with $mod and over all the window, not only its title).<br />
So if you prefer to keep out configurable mouse bindings and prefer to hardcode specific bindings (if they fit well), feel free to close this bug report ;)<br />

I would like to say that I would very much like this feature too!<br />
</p>
<p>
My original idea can be best described by sample config entries:<br />
bindmouse button1 focus<br />
bindmouse button2 kill<br />
bindmouse button3 move scratchpad<br />
bindmouse shift+button1 move container to workspace 10<br />
etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
The bindings defined above should work only for clicks on title bars.<br />

Thank you for your work on i3!<br />

<p>
I believe the reason that "we need it soon" and "so many people want it" have been mentioned is specifically because <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1104" title="defect: Disable switching workspaces or windows via mouse (closed: fixed)">#1104</a> has been merged with <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/558" title="enhancement: Different kinds of clicking (closed: fixed)">#558</a>, which has been open for two years and marked as "trivial". No one is saying not to do it cleanly, we're simply saying that for some of us the issues in <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1104" title="defect: Disable switching workspaces or windows via mouse (closed: fixed)">#1104</a> aren't "trivial" and we're concerned on how that issue is being addressed, or not addressed as the case may be.<br />

<p>
This is beginning to go through now.<br />
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of activity going on with i3bar that is higher priority than this, so I'm going to put off the proper solution for a bit. If you really want something now though, apply <a class="ext-link" href="http://cr.i3wm.org/patch/296"><span class="icon">​</span>this patch</a> which allows you to do something like:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">bar {
    i3bar_command /path/to/i3bar --noninteractive
}
</pre><p>
and that will disable all clicking on the bar (except tray icons I think).<br />
</p>
<p>
As for the other feature which was requested in <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1104" title="defect: Disable switching workspaces or windows via mouse (closed: fixed)">#1104</a>, disabling the scrolling and clicking on tabbed window decorations, I'm doubting right now whether we can do that cleanly because of how specific it is.<br />
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, disabling mouse interaction with i3 completely is not a feature I think people want because drag resize/move and click to focus are kind of essential. On the other hand, I don't think a config directive like <tt>disable-scrolling-and-clicking-on-tabbed-window-decorations yes</tt> is going to be in accordance with Michael's idea of doing it "clean".<br />
</p>
<p>
So if you can think of a rule somewhere in between along with a way to explain it to people in the docs that we can agree on, I will implement it.<br />

I'll summarize the current state of this feature as I see it now.<br />

<p>
Replying to <a class="ticket" href="/report/ticket/558#comment:3" title="Comment 3">p.staszewski@…</a>:<br />
</p>
<p>
I think this is the best implementation that has been suggested so far. The command will look like this:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">bindmouse [ModN[+...]]ButtonM &lt;command&gt;
</pre><p>
With the following behavior:<br />
</p>
<ol><li>The command will only take effect if a window title bar is clicked.
</li><li>A command that takes effect will be in the context of the window whose title bar was clicked (i.e., that window is assumed to be focused)
</li><li>A bindmouse directive will override the default behavior of the click.
</li></ol><p>
This should allow the user to no-op any default mouse behavior they do not like (implementing <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1104" title="defect: Disable switching workspaces or windows via mouse (closed: fixed)">#1104</a>).<br />
</p>
<p>
It also allows for the user to easily configure the most obvious use for this feature, that is, right/middle click/scroll wheel on the title bars, without interfering with an application's own handling of click events.<br />
</p>
<p>
A problem I can see with this is that there would be no way to reproduce the default "scroll" mouse wheel feature (perhaps in the opposite direction). Maybe a <tt>--no-focus</tt> flag should be taken to mean that the command should not focus the window.<br />
</p>
<p>
How does that sound?<br />

Points 1. and 2. - exactly.<br />
Point 3. - why have a hard-coded behaviour? I would leave it as an entirely config file choice. If you don't setup <tt>bindmouse</tt> the title bars will simply not react to any mouse clicks.<br />

<p>
Honestly I did not consider scroll wheel at that time...<br />
</p>
<p>
I would introduce it as a command though:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">focus cycle &lt;left|right&gt;
</pre><p>
So that to get the currently default behaviour:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">bindmouse Button4 focus cycle left
bindnouse Button5 focus cycle right
</pre><p>
I haven't looked at the implementation, but form the user's point-of-view the current mouse scrolling of windows behaves differently from <tt>focus &lt;left|right&gt;</tt> (i.e. mouse wheel cycles windows only within current container - it won't switch containers).<br />
</p>
<p>
As for the <tt>--no-focus</tt> flag - I don't see where I would want to use it.<br />

I’m not entirely sure if this is a good idea. Using e.g. <tt>bindmouse Mod4+Button1 exec my_popup_menu</tt> may be a useful thing to have. But then again, we can probably add a flag later, e.g. <tt>bindmouse Mod4+Button1 --entire-window exec my_popup_menu</tt><br />

I don’t think you explicitly need to write this, given that clicking first focuses the window anyway due to focus-on-click. Also note that scrolling internally is a click<br />

A problem I can see with this is that there would be no way to reproduce the default "scroll" mouse wheel feature (perhaps in the opposite direction). Maybe a <tt>--no-focus</tt> flag should be taken to mean that the command should not focus the window.<br />

I’m not entirely sure if this is a good idea. Using e.g. <tt>bindmouse Mod4+Button1 exec my_popup_menu</tt> may be a useful thing to have. But then again, we can probably add a flag later, e.g. <tt>bindmouse Mod4+Button1 --entire-window exec my_popup_menu</tt><br />

<p>
A flag, later on - I'm all for it; but later on.<br />
</p>
<p>
Disregarding the fact that most apps already have mouse bindings inside their 'space', my idea here was to 'compensate' for the lack of the close/max|min buttons commonly found on most title bars - with the 'twist' that there are no icons, just mouse button bindings, and that they are fully-configurable.<br />
</p>
<p>
I have probably expressed that on the IRC channel already, but: I personally have two distinct modes of WM interaction: keyboard driven, and mouse driven. While the keyboard gives me (extreme) flexibility the mouse gives me simplicity and one-hand operation.<br />
</p>
<p>
As of now I can focus any window with the mouse. My main <strong>real</strong> problem is that I can't close <strong>every</strong> window with the mouse (only those that have, obviously, a button or a menu option for that).<br />
</p>
<p>
Given the above I would be satisfied with the simple default binding that right-click on a title bar means kill that window. Given the fact that I do like the flexibility I was looking for a more configurable approach.<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">
<p>
I don’t think you explicitly need to write this, given that clicking first focuses the window anyway due to focus-on-click. Also note that scrolling internally is a click<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree focus (and click context) should be obvious - but then the scroll wheel cycling (as it works now) may make it a little blurry, so I confirmed the approach.<br />
</p>
<p>
And yes, I do realize that scroll wheel is just a click. Funny thing though is that I didn't think about it that way intuitively when I was first posting my request. I guess the physical acts of clicking and scrolling with a wheel are distinct enough to enforce a mental notion that these are handled differently.<br />

<p>
I agree.<br />
</p>
<p>
I assume the above then necessitates something like a <tt>noop</tt> command (or <tt>off</tt>, or <tt>disable</tt>; I'll leave the language of that to you), in order to override the default mouse key bindings - but that should be trivial.<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote class="citation">

<p>
I believe the answer to that is two-fold.<br />
</p>
<p>
First - mouse wheel scrolling right now works whenever the mouse pointer is on <strong>any</strong> title bar - it just cycles from whatever the currently focused window is, in direction appropriate to the scroll direction.<br />
</p>
<p>
Given the premise 'command is executed for the window the title bar we click' this may seem to break the logic a bit - for mouse wheel cycle we should cycle left|right relative to the currently focused window, i.e. not do 'first focus the window for which the mouse pointer is over the title bar' (hope this makes sense).<br />
</p>
<p>
The second part is that cycling as it works now is distinct from the <tt>focus &lt;left|right&gt;</tt>, as it does not cross containers. Hence the suggestion to have a separate command for this exact behaviour.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
I hope I've managed to clarify.<br />

I didn't mean to imply that the container would automatically be focused by the activation of a bindmouse command. Let me amend my specification of behavior 2:<br />

<ol start="2"><li>A command that takes effect will be in the context of the container whose title bar was clicked (i.e., that container is assumed to be uniquely <strong>selected by criteria</strong>).
</li></ol><p>
Of course, when I say "a title bar was clicked" I mean a <tt>ButtonPress</tt> event was detected with pointer coordinates within the bounds of a title bar.<br />

If we were to automatically focus a container, we could not meet the requirements of <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1104" title="defect: Disable switching workspaces or windows via mouse (closed: fixed)">#1104</a>, because it would not be possible to truly no-op the mouse wheel (or any other button) over title bars.<br />
</p>
<p>
To illustrate how this works, consider the directive:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">bindmouse Button1 floating enable
</pre><p>
and suppose the binding is activated with <tt>$clicked_con_id</tt> holding the <a class="ext-link" href="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#command_criteria"><span class="icon">​</span>con_id</a> of the clicked container. Then the following command would be sent to i3:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[con_id="$clicked_con_id"] floating enable
</pre><p>
If some command requires the container to be focused to act on the container (e.g., <tt>move &lt;direction&gt;</tt>, which ignores the criteria and acts upon the focused container instead), the user may explicitly focus the container first:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">bindmouse Button1 focus; move left
</pre><p>
which will work as expected. However, these commands should implement criteria matching eventually.<br />

Why not name them “focus wheel_up” and “focus wheel_down”? That makes it more clear what their intention is, I think.

The name could use some work. It's difficult to think of something simple to describe this that doesn't use specialist vocabulary.<br />
</p>
<p>
Using <tt>wheel_up</tt> and <tt>wheel_down</tt> seems opinionated to me and could be confusing. For instance, suppose I bind the button "wheel up" to the command <tt>wheel_down</tt>. Now what happens when I press the button "wheel up" on tabs? How long did it take you to figure it out?<br />
</p>
<p>
<tt>cycle_next</tt> and <tt>cycle_previous</tt> has the exact same problem because it's not clear which is the first and which is the last container. In a stack, the lowest index is at the top. If you think about it, this is the opposite of how things are ordinarily ordered (such as the standard representation of a Cartesian cross).<br />

Yes, i3bar should have a similar feature. Since it is not a managed window, it will have to be implemented separately. The details of this implementation is still an open issue.<br />

I think a great deal of complication could be avoided if i3 could simply bind a command to various mousebinds; this would easily allow users to use xdotool to set mouse actions to already existing keybinds:<br />
</p>
<p>
bindmouse $mod+Button2 command; xdotool key Alt+Shift+q<br />
-or-<br />
bindmouse $mod+Button2 command; sh /home/user/some/xdotool/script.sh<br />
</p>
<p>
In this way, you wouldnt even have to have a container or titlebar for an app. It could be "context" driven (similar to how Openbox has "desktop" and "frame" context options). That said, I think having configurable mouseactions for titlebar clicks is a unique and very good idea for those that use them.<br />

<p>
As for the bar I have no idea...<br />

I think that is an excellent idea feature-wise. I'm working on a more general way to intercept commands for custom scripting in <a class="closed ticket" href="/report/ticket/1210" title="enhancement: Add an IPC &#34;Command&#34; Event (now &#34;Binding&#34; Event) (closed: fixed)">#1210</a> which I think would pair very well with the new mouse binding feature and let you accomplish what you are after in a cleaner way.<br />
</p>
<p>
As for the status of this feature itself, most of the refactoring required for implementing the feature is complete and I plan to put most of my i3-development effort into this next week.<br />

Bindmouse is done. It will be merged soon. Here is how it turned out:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">=== Mouse bindings

A mouse binding makes i3 execute a command upon pressing a specific mouse
button in the scope of the clicked container (see &lt;&lt;command_criteria&gt;&gt;). You
can configure mouse bindings in a similar way to key bindings.

*Syntax*:
----------------------------------
bindsym [Modifiers+]button[n] command
----------------------------------

If the binding has no modifiers, it will only run when you click on the
titlebar of the window. Otherwise, it will run when any part of the window is
clicked.

*Examples*:
--------------------------------
# The middle button over a titlebar kills the window
bindsym button2 kill

# The middle button and a modifer over any part of the window kills the window
bindsym $mod+button2 kill

# The right button toggles floating
bindsym button3 floating toggle
bindsym $mod+button3 floating toggle

# The side buttons move the window around
bindsym button9 move left
bindsym button8 move right
--------------------------------

I'm not going to do mouse bindings over i3bar because it's too complicated.<br />

<pre class="wiki">Feature: implement mouse bindings

A configured mouse binding (for example `bindsym button3 kill`) runs
its command when the mouse button is pressed over parts of a container.

If the binding has no modifer, it will only run when the button is
clicked on the window titlebar.

Otherwise if the binding has a modifier, it will run over the titlebar
or any part of the contained window.
