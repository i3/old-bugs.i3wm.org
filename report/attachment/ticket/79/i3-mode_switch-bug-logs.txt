I'm trying to make window fullscreen using the keys 'f' and winkey (Mod4 on my notebook)

=== 1. Version built from git with the default config ===
==== 1.1 English layout - keybinding works ====
 - client is made fullscreen
 - nothing is sent to the client (usual behaviour)
 - mode_switch is not applied
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:07 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 64
02/28/2010 10:34:07 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:07 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:108 - (removed upper 8 bits, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:07 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:119 - (checked mode_switch, state 64)    <--- here
}}}
==== 1.2 Russian layout - keybinding doesn't work ====
 - making client fullscreen FAILS
 - NOTHING is sent to the client (but should be, because the keybinding is not processed by wm)
 - mode_switch IS applied
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:11 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 64
02/28/2010 10:34:11 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:11 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:108 - (removed upper 8 bits, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:11 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:119 - (checked mode_switch, state 320)   <--- here
}}}
==== 1.3 Normal input works normal ====

=== 2. Version built from git with modified config ===
the following line was added to the config
{{{
bindsym Mod4+Mode_switch+f f
}}}
==== 2.1 English layout - keybinding works ====
 - client is made fullscreen
 - nothing is sent to the client
 - mode_switch is not applied
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:47 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 64
02/28/2010 10:34:47 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:47 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:108 - (removed upper 8 bits, state = 64)
02/28/2010 10:34:47 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:119 - (checked mode_switch, state 64)    <--- here
}}}
==== 2.2 Russian layout - keybinding works ====
 - client is made fullscreen
 - nothing is sent to the client
 - mode_switch IS applied
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:49 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 64
02/28/2010 10:34:49 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 64)

}}}
====  2.3 Normal input DOESN'T work in russian layout: ====
When I press a 'f' key in english layout, it is caught by wm, but then transfered to the client
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:54 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 0
02/28/2010 10:34:54 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 0)
02/28/2010 10:34:54 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:108 - (removed upper 8 bits, state = 0)
02/28/2010 10:34:54 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:119 - (checked mode_switch, state 0)     <--- here
}}}
But when I press a russian 'Ð°' (the same button), it is transfered to the client as 'f' key, so I can't enter any russian letter located on a bound button
{{{
02/28/2010 10:34:52 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:100 - Keypress 41, state raw = 0
02/28/2010 10:34:52 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:104 - (removed numlock, state = 0)
02/28/2010 10:34:52 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:108 - (removed upper 8 bits, state = 0)
02/28/2010 10:34:52 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_key_press:119 - (checked mode_switch, state 256)   <--- here
}}}

=== 3. Patched version ===
In the version with those lines removed, everything works as one should have expected. In both cases (ru, en) log is equal to the case 1.1.
Normal input works and nothing is caught by wm at all.
