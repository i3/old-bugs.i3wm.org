Subject: [PATCH] Fix Samantha's bug

For some reason, when you are on another tty, `create_cursor` will not
actually create the cursor. I think this is just quirky behavior in
either XCB or the X server itself (why should it change anything whether
or not the server has a visual representation on a monitor?).

And then of course, when the pointer is grabbed, the grabber has
control, including but not limited to the cursor itself. Reinitializing
the grab giving the correctly made cursor will work.

At the time of expose, the cursor can be created. The grab will override
the previous one.

I think this could be refactored so that creating the cursor and
grabbing the inputs are done primarily asynchronously.
